# üßë‚Äçüíª DSA & Problem Solving Practice

Welcome to my DSA practice repository! This repo is a collection of code, notes, and solutions from various platforms such as LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, along with self-study materials and utility scripts. This is also a personal portfolio that shows the learning process, developing programming skills, and solving problems.

## üìù Instructions for use

- **Look up documents**: Go to the `Docs/` folder, select the topic you are interested in (Array, Linked List, Big O, Sorting, etc.).
- **View exercise solutions**:
- Go to `Solutions/Leetcode/` or `Solutions/GeekforGeeks/`.
- Name the file in the format: `ID-short-article-name.language` (for example: `001-two-sum.py`).
- Each solution should include notes, complexity analysis, and a link to the original problem.
- **Run supporting scripts**: Refer to `Scripts/`, read the instructions in each script file.
